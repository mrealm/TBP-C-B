\section{Record Maintenance and Transition} Records must be kept up-to-date and in good order. The complete records must be given  to the new officers at the officer/advisor transition meeting. The treasurer must turn over copies of his/her records; however, original records will be kept until after the treasurer files the appropriate tax return forms for the chapter.
