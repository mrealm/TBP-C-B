\chapter{Dissolution}\label{sec:dissolution}
 In the event that the chapter ceases to exist, any residual assets are bequeathed to the ``Tau Beta Pi  Centennial Endowment Fund" with the University of Michigan. For the purposes of this section ``residual assets" do not include initiation supplies, any Tau Beta Pi or Michigan Gamma insignia, or any assets belonging to joint ventures. Assets belonging to joint ventures must be left to the adjoining parties to be disposed of at their discretion. Initiation supplies and Tau Beta Pi or Michigan Gamma insignia must revert to the national organization, to be disposed of at its discretion. Should any of these result in assets being distributed to an organization not dedicated to one of the exempt purposes outlined in Article~\ref{sec:objectives}, those assets will be instead distributed to one or more such purposes on a case-by-case basis.
